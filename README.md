# Docs-Studio

This repository contains a simple interactive demo that lets you preview text as you type.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser. You will see an editor on the left and a preview pane on the right. Anything you type in the editor will appear instantly in the preview pane.

This small example demonstrates how you might build more advanced documentation tools.
